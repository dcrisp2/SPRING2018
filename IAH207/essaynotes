THESIS 4: Monster Dwells at the Gates of Difference

"The monster is difference made flesh... [T]he monster is an incorporation of the Outside, the Beyond... 
Any kind of alterity [difference] can be inscribed across (constructed trhough the monstrous body, 
but for the most part monstrous difference tends to be cultural, political, racial, economic, sexual."

It is "difference made flesh": cultural, racial, sexual, economic, political differences are 
represented in bodily terms as 'monstrous'

Monsters are created from "The exaggeration of cultural difference into monstrous aberration"

One kind of difference can be represented as another kind (e.g., racial difference can be sexualized)

Monstrous difference is used to define 'normality'

The Bible describes aboriginal Canaanites as "giants" (to justify Hebrew colonization)

Politicians are described as "monstrous," physically, sexually, or morally (to disenfranchise their 
political beliefs: e.g., Richard III)

African peoples historically depicted as hyper-sexual (to justify the policing of borders, 
restriction of immigration)

Consequences...
The creation of such "monsters" of difference can thus invite action or violence.
Those who then defeat such "monsters" can call themselves heroes.

		You're afraid to dive into the plasma pool, aren't you? You're afraid to be destroyed and recreated, 
		aren't you? I'll bet you think that you woke me up about the flesh, don't you? But you only know 
		society's straight line about the flesh. You can't penetrate beyond society's sick, gray, fear 
		of the flesh. Drink deep, or taste not, the plasma spring! Y'see what I'm saying? And I'm not 
		just talking about sex and penetration. I'm talking about penetration beyond the veil of the flesh!
		A deep penetrating dive into the plasma pool!
